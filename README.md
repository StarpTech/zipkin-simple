> A simple node.js client for [zipkin](http://zipkin.io) tracing system


This is a basic alternative to the official (and more complete) [zipkin-js](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-js).

Focus of this version is being easier to use and having a more idiomatic api.

## Current Caveats

- Only http transport
- Only standard annotations (client send, client receive, server send and server receive)
- Requests are not batched
- No sampling

This features will probably be added in the near future (with the exclusion of other transports)

## Install

```
npm install zipkin-simple --save
```

## Usage

```js
var Tracer = require('zipkin-simple')

Tracer.options({
  debug: false,
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: "9411",
  path: "/api/v1/spans"
})

var trace_data = Tacer.get_data()
Tracer.client_send(trace_data, {
  service: 'service name',
  name: 'endpoint name'
})
```

The basic idea is that the tracer only manage the comunication to the zipkin server and lets you manage the trace data however you prefer.

This means that it's up to you on how to store the trace data and how to sync that among clients and servers.

Zipkin suggest to use http headers, but you are free to use anything else.

## API

We use the names "client process" and "server process" as in zipkin documentation but zipkin-simple can also be used in a single process environment or to track local methods. In this case consider "client process" as the caller method and server process as the colled method.

You alson don't need to send both client and server annotation, especially when tracking local methods.
Just one of the two couples will suffice to zipkin to correctly generate the spans

All methods are in "underscore" notation but provide camelCase aliases, use the one that fits your style better.

See an usage example in [seneca-zipkin-tracer](https://github.com/senecajs-labs/seneca-zipkin-tracer)

<a name="options"></a>
### Tracer.options(opts)

If opts is passed in update current options, otherwise just return existing options.

Options include:
- debug: wether to write debug info to the console
- host: the hostname or ip address for the zipkin server
- port: the port for the http transport of the zipkin server
- path: the endpoint where to send data on the zipkin server (if uncertain, leave the default unchanged)

<a name="get_data"></a>
### Tracer.get_data(trace_data)

Return trace data to be sent alongside the next request.

If next annotation is part of an existing trace provide `trace_data`. If `trace_data` is not passed in a new trace with a root span is generated.

<a name="get_child"></a>
### Tracer.get_child(trace_data)

Return trace data to be sent alongside the next child request.

This is used to generate a child span, in example when the current request calls another endpoint before completing.

`trace_data` is mandatory and should be the data related to the current span.

<a name="client_send"></a>
### Tracer.client_send(trace_data, annotation_data)

Add the `cs` to the current span (and trace).

This is intended to be used on the client process just before it fires a request to the server.

Both trace_data and annotation_data are mandatory

<a name="annotation_data"></a>
Annotation Data contains additional info about the current method:
- service: the name of the current service. It should be an identifier of running process (or class of processes), i.e.: `web_server`, `background_worker`, `checkout_process`. This will be displayed in the zipkin console
- name: the name of the method being tracked, i.e.: `POST /user` or `update_credentials`. Thi will be displayed in the zipking console on the single span

<a name="client_receive"></a>
### Tracer.client_receive(trace_data, annotation_data)

Add the `cr` to the current span (and trace).

This is intended to be used on the client process when it receives data back from the server.

Both trace_data and annotation_data are mandatory.

[For details about annotation_data see here](#annotation_data)


<a name="server_receive"></a>
### Tracer.server_receive(trace_data, annotation_data)

Add the `sr` to the current span (and trace).

This is intended to be used on the server process as soon it receives data from the client.

Both trace_data and annotation_data are mandatory.

[For details about annotation_data see here](#annotation_data)

<a name="server_send"></a>
### Tracer.server_send(trace_data, annotation_data)

Add the `ss` to the current span (and trace).

This is intended to be used on the server process when it has completed its operations and is about to send data back to the client.

Both trace_data and annotation_data are mandatory.
